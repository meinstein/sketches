# Sketches

### Environment

- Install Processing
- Install `processing-java`
- To run from the command line: `processing-java --sketch=/Users/maxeinstein/me/sketches/<sketch-dir> --force --run`
- Or, simply open & run in the processing IDE.

### Website

Each final product is listed in `index.html`. To avoid overloading the DOM with complicated SVG and crossing Git's storage capabilities, the final products (SVG files, JPGs, and AI files) are stored in the `sketch-1` bucket under the lalx project.
